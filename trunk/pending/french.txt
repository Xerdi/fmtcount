Hello, I find little errors in the fmtcount package, when used on
french (sorry for my bad english) :

According to the documentation of frenchb babel option
(http://daniel.flipo.free.fr/frenchb/frenchb2-doc.pdf) and other
sources, the good abbreviation for  première, deuxième, troisième,
quatrième, etc are not 1\texsuperscript{ere},
2\textsuperscript{eme}, 3\textsuperscript{eme} ...

The abbreviations "ere" and "eme" are not correct in good
typesetting, and the text must be little than with \textsuperscript.

And in french 0 is z\'ero (zéro).

The PDF frenchb2-doc.pdf give the good typesetting : on page 4 you
can read that 1\ier give 1er, 1\iere give 1re, 2\eme give 2e, 3\eme
give 3e (sorry I can not in my email software use superscript).
You can also see on page 9  the difference between \textsuperscript
and the command \up (alias for the command \fup) used for produce
the good 1er, 1re, 2e ... (\up and \fup are definited by the frenchb
babel option).

The option \fmtcountsetoptions{abbrv=...} seems to be unnecessary.
What do you think about this ?

So, in fc-french.def you must change this :

For the dialect swiss or belgian, for 70 this is not septente, but
septante and for 90 this is not nonente but nonante (lines 91, 93,
177, 179),  and 611, 613, 697, 699 for septenti/septanti and
nonenti/nonanti
On line 607, not trentrième, but trentième.
On line 693, not Trentrième, but Trentième.
On line 340, 362, 384, 406, 428, 450, not milième, but millième (2L)
On line 473, 495, 517, 539, 561, 583, not Milième, but Millième (2L)
I hope I have nothing forget.

French rules are very complicated 

80 = quatre-vingts (this is correct by fmtcount)
but
80 000 = quatre-vingt mille  (no "s") (fmtcount say "quatre-vingts
mille")

In attachment, you will find a PDF with the corrections to make
(numbers from 1 to 280, from 1000 to 1279 and from 2000 to 2179).
You can see a lot of "un" and "et" that are incorrects.
An online writer of number can be find here :
http://www.leconjugueur.com/frnombre.php (with belgian and swiss
option).
An you can read the rule here :
http://www.leconjugueur.com/frlesnombres.php

Can I suggest you to add an option named for exemple "reforme" for
the "réforme de l'orthographe de 1990" ? With this reforme, all
number have "-" between words. So 122 without 'reforme' will be
"cent vingt-deux" and with the 1990 réforme will be
"cent-vingt-deux".

I'm very sorry about the work for the correct french 

Thanks.
