        Hi Nicola, good day,

        My name is Fernando Maldonado Millán,
        I'm from Cancún, México.
        Recently I have used your packages (dt and fc)
        but the spanish translation doesn't reach
        my needs, so i've took the work to correct them.
        So i'm sending you the modified files,
        maybe there are some erros in the file (more words than the
ones
        needed), but at least
        the translation fits de standars for the mexican dates and
numbers.

        Thanks for your packages.

        Greetings from Mexico
